comments  #
escape sequence in python (in this we are using in print)
    --> IT IS BASICALLY USED FOR CHARACTERS WHICH CAN'T BE USED IN A STRING 
            IT IS REPRESENTED AS \(BACKSLASH)<AN-CHARACTER>
                        EG:- \n   (it is called new line character)
                            \"  it is useful in like print("Hello \"Raj\" how are you") 






eg-covered

print("Hello \"Raj\" how are you")  # this was used so that it can print "" as well in output
print('Hello \'Raj\' how are you') # this will also generate similar output
print('Hello "Raj" how are you')    # we can also use combination of '' and "" as well in this type of scenarios

print("Hey",5,6)                        # output Hey 5 6
print("Hey",5,6, sep="~")               # Hey~5~6
print("Hey",5,6, sep="~", end="007")    # Hey~5~6007
