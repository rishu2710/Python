    function

    it is defined with def keyword followd by a name which will be the function name and followed by pranthesis() within which variables 
    we use return keyword when we want to return anything from function outside wich can be stored in a variable where it was called and return can return any type of value.



def calculateGmean(a, b):
  mean = (a*b)/(a+b)
  print(mean)

def isGreater(a, b):
  if(a>b):
    print("First number is greater")
  else:
    print("Second number is greater or equal")

def isLesser(a, b):
  pass
  

a = 9
b = 8
isGreater(a, b)
calculateGmean(a, b)
# gmean1 = (a*b)/(a+b)
# print(gmean1)
c = 8
d = 74
isGreater(c, d)
calculateGmean(c, d)
# gmean2 = (c*d)/(c+d)
# print(gmean2)
