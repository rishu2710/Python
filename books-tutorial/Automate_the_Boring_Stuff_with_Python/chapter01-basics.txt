expression :- value/variable with operator in between.
operators :- Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for logical and arithmetic operations
        1. Arithmetic
                + (Addition Operator)                   1+2         3           left to right
                - (Subtraction Operator)                2-1         1           left to right
                * (Multiplication Operator)             2*1         2           left to right
                / (Float Division Operator)             5/2         2.5         left to right
                // (Floor Division Operator)            5//2        2           left to right
                % (Modulas Division Operator)           5%2         1           left to right
                ** (Power Operator)                     2**3        8           right to left   a ** b ** c i.e. a**(b**c)

                The precedence of Arithmetic Operators in Python is as follows:
                   1. P - Parentheses
                   2. E - Exponentiation
                   3. M - Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)
                   4. D - Division
                   5. A - Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)
                   6. S - Subtraction

        2. Comparison
                > (Greater Then)                      2>1           True
                < (Less Then)                         2<1           False
                == (Equals To)                        2==1          False
                != (Not Equals To)                    2 != 1        True
                >= (Greter Then or Equal)             2 >= 1        True
                <= (Less Then or Equal)               2<=1          False

                In this precedence of all operator is same.
                Spaces can be present b/w value and operators
                There is only 2 result (True/False)

        3. Logical
                not (Logical not)                     not a         False       not 0       true
                and (Logical and)                     a and b       False
                or  (Logical or)                      a or b        True

                Precedence is same as defined not >> and >> or 
                There is only 2 result (True/False)
                It only takes boolean values

        4. Bitwise (it converts variabls to binary then it works on same.)
                ~ (Bitwise not)    :            ~ 5             -6
                        1. Flips all bits of a number. Converts 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
                         we can skip (reverse the binary) (1st compliment) (MSB also get changed from 0 --> 1  0 indicates +  and 1 indicates -)
                         Now we need to find the decimal value of this converted binary so we will invert all binary
                        2. Add + 1 in binary
                        i.e. 5        0  0000 0101
                                      1  1111 1010
                                      1  0000 0101
                                                +1
                                         0000 0110     = 6
                        and msb (most significant bit) is 1 so final output will be -6

                >> (Bitwise right shift)
                        Shifts bits of the number to the right, discarding bits shifted out, and fills with the sign bit (arithmetic shift)
                        x >> y :-
                                1. it converts x into 8 bit binary no.
                                2. it shift every binary of x towards right y times

                                i.e. 16 >> 2
                                        16 =  0001 0000 it need to be shifted 2 positons towards right
                                              0000 0100 ie. 4 Ans 
                << (Bitwise left shift)
                        Similar thing will happen in this but towards left side
                & (Bitwise and)
                        This will only provide 1 when both condition satisfies
                        and if any one condition is 0 it will always prvide 0
                        eg :- 5 & 3
                              5 = 0000 0101
                              3 = 0000 0011
                                  0000 0001     1 Ans
                ^ (Bitwise XOR)
                        When both binary are same it will give 0 as binary and vise versa 1
                         eg :- 5 ^ 3
                              5 = 0000 0101
                              3 = 0000 0011
                                  0000 0110     6 Ans

                | (Bitwise or)
                        This will give true if any one condition is true
                        eg :- 5 | 3
                              5 = 0000 0101
                              3 = 0000 0011
                                  0000 0111     7 Ans

        5. Assignment
                =               x = 2                    x = 2
                +=              x += 2                   x = x+2
                -=              x -= 2                   x = x-2
                *=              ...
                /=              ...
                %=              ...
                //=             ...
                **=             ...
                &=              ...
                |=              ...
                ^=              ...
                >>=             ...
                <<=             ...

        6. Identity :- It used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory.
                is      True if the operands are identical           
                is not  True if the operands are not identical 

                        a = 10
                        b = 20
                        c = a

                        print(a is not b)
                        print(a is c)

        7. Membership
                in      True if value is found in the sequence 
                not in  True if value is not found in the sequence
                        It will return either True/False

                        x = 24
                        y = 20
                        list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

                        if (x not in list):
                        print("x is NOT present in given list")
                        else:
                        print("x is present in given list")

                        if (y in list):
                        print("y is present in given list")
                        else:
                        print("y is NOT present in given list")


        8. Ternary 
                syntax: [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 
                eg :
                    a, b = 10, 20
                    min = a if a < b else b
                    print(min)

Data Types
        A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type.
        1. Built In
                1. Numeric
                        int     10, -42, 1000000
                        float   3.14, -0.01, 2.5e3
                        complex 3 + 4j, where 3 is the real part, and 4j is the imaginary part.

                2. Sequence
                        str     'hello', "world", """multiline"""
                        blank sring or empty string ''          (A string with no character)
                        list    [1, 2, 3], ['a', 10, 3.5]
                        tuple   (1, 2, 3), ('a', 10, 3.5)
                        range   range(5) (produces numbers 0 to 4)

                3. Mapping Type
                        dict    {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

                4. Set Type
                        set     {1, 2, 3}, {'a', 'b', 'c'}
                        frozenset frozenset({1, 2, 3}) immutable version of set

                5. Boolean Type
                        bool    True or False

                6. Binary Type
                        bytes   
                                Immutable sequence of bytes.
                                Each byte is an integer value between 0 and 255.
                                Often used for:
                                        Encoding/decoding data.
                                        Reading binary files.
                                        Transmitting data over networks.

                                        b = b'hello'  # Using the `b` prefix for a byte literal.
                                        print(b)  # Output: b'hello'

                                        b = "hello".encode('utf-8')  # Encoding a string into bytes.
                                        print(b)  # Output: b'hello'

                                        b = bytes([65, 66, 67])  # ASCII codes for 'A', 'B', 'C'.
                                        print(b)  # Output: b'ABC'

                                        b = bytes(range(5))
                                        print(b)  # Output: b'\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04'

                                        b = b'hello'
                                        b[0] = 72  # Raises TypeError: 'bytes' object does not support item assignment

                        bytesarray
                                Represents a mutable sequence of bytes.

                                        ba = bytearray([65, 66, 67])
                                        print(ba)  # Output: bytearray(b'ABC')

                                        ba = bytearray(b'hello')
                                        print(ba)  # Output: bytearray(b'hello')

                                        ba = bytearray(b'hello')
                                        ba[0] = 72  # Modify the first byte to ASCII value 72 ('H')
                                        print(ba)  # Output: bytearray(b'Hello')

                                        ba.append(33)  # Append ASCII value 33 ('!')
                                        print(ba)  # Output: bytearray(b'Hello!')

                                        ba.extend(b' world')
                                        print(ba)  # Output: bytearray(b'Hello! world')

                        memoryview
                                Represents a memory-efficient view of a binary object (like bytes or bytearray).
                                Allows manipulation of binary data without copying it.

                                        b = bytearray(b'hello world')
                                        mv = memoryview(b)
                                        print(mv[0])  # Output: 104 (ASCII for 'h')

                                        mv[0] = 72  # Modify the first byte to ASCII value 72 ('H')
                                        print(b)  # Output: bytearray(b'Hello world')

                                        sub_mv = mv[6:11]  # Slice from index 6 to 10
                                        print(bytes(sub_mv))  # Output: b'world'


        2. User defined
                Classes and objects allow you to define your custom data types.
                We will cover this later in class and Object topic
        3. Type checking
                To check the type of a variable
                print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

        4. Special Type
                Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
                x = None


String operations
        print('Alice' + 'Bob')                  # output  AliceBob
        print('Alice' * 5)                      # output  AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice  in 2nd place string won't work here

Key Points 
        A variable is initialized (or created) the first time a value is stored in it

Variable Defination
        hyphens are not allowed
        spaces are not allowed
        can’t begin with a number, underscore
        special characters like $ ' are not allowed
        variables are case sensitive

Functions
        print()
                This can be used to print anything in bw brackets and if we leave it as it is it will print an empty line.
        
        input()
                This can be used to take user input, generally it takes every input as a string

        len()
                This gives the length of any str variable

        str()
                To convert any variable in string format

        int()
                To convert any variable in integer format.
                It is useful if you need to round a floating-point number down.
                eg. int(7.7) + 1        # output 8

        float()
                To convert any variable in float format
